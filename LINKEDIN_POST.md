🚀 Just built a Fully Automated AWS WordPress Monitoring Stack! 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest project where I've automated the deployment of a production-ready WordPress application with a complete monitoring stack using Terraform on AWS.

This project solves the need for repeatable, secure infrastructure with built-in observability and zero manual configuration.

🏗️ **Architecture & Features:**
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Fully automated deployment using Terraform.
*   **Secure Networking:** Isolated public/private subnets with a private RDS instance.
*   **Automated Configuration:** WordPress is installed and configured automatically on launch.
*   **Observability:** Integrated Prometheus & Grafana stack for real-time monitoring of EC2, WordPress, and CloudWatch metrics.

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
*   Terraform
*   AWS (EC2, RDS, VPC)
*   Prometheus & Node Exporter
*   Grafana
*   WordPress

It was a great experience bringing together IaC and observability into a single automated workflow.
